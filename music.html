									<h3>Song: Rain (Opening 5 of Full metal Alchemist Brotherhood) by Sid</h3>
										<p>Song Structure: Verse-Bridge-Chorus-Verse-Bridge-Chorus-Chorus-Chorus<br><br>
										The first two lines that draws attention<br>
										Chorus 1, line 2:
										Why did the rain choose me when I have no way to escape?<br>
										Chorus 3, line 2:
										Why did the rain choose me? Will it be okay to wrap myself in it? <br><br>
										Here rain signifies turmoil/bad times. The first line vibes with 'why me' thinking, whereas the second line alludes to being 
										consumed by turmoil. More specifically, first line signifies 2nd stage of grief/loss <b>Anger</b> and second line denotes 
										4th stage <b>Depression</b>. This made me hypothesize that the theme of the song is <b>Grief</b>. 
										What remains to be seen is whether the other stages are also there.<br>
										Also, from this point on, I will be using rain and grief/loss interchangeably, except inside lyrics.<br><br>
										<strong>Stage 1: Denial</strong> <br>
										(Verse 1, line 1):
										June lies, and the truth right before my eyes, are stowed away in sepia tones<br><br>
										The onset of rainy season is June in Japan. So, this represents the onset of grief/loss. The first stage of grief is <b>Denial</b>, which is represented by
										<i>Truth stowed away</i> quite straightforwardly.<br><br>
										<strong>Stage 2: Anger</strong> <br> 
										(Chorus 1 Line 2: Already explained)<br><br>
										<strong>Stage 3: Bargaining</strong> <br> 
										(Verse 2, Line 1): Time gets in the way of the new morning that I finally found<br>
										I am not quite satisfied with the interpretation here. Two types of thinking is observed during this stage:<br>
										a) If  only I had done this... (Bargaining to change outcome)<br>
										b) If only time allowed... (Bargaining to change timing)<br>
										Towards this end, this part can mean bargaining to change time.<br><br>
										<strong>Stage 4: Depression</strong> <br> 
										(Chorus 3 Line 2: Already explained)<br><br>
										<strong>Stage 5: Acceptance</strong> <br> 
										(Chorus 4): I don't know when the rain will stop, and it keeps pouring down even today<br>
										As we softly huddle close together for warmth under an extended umbrella<br>
										In the first line, it has been realized that the damage caused by grief/loss is permanent. In the second line, rain has been embraced as unavoidable and 
										the best possible measure during the turmoil has been undertaken. Also, this is the last part. If the theme is indeed grief/loss, I have to find acceptance
										here by hook or by crook.<br></br>
										Interestingly, Grief/Loss is a very recurring theme in FMAB. Each sacrificial character has gone through some forms of grief/loss in their life and 
										 represents a different stage of grief/loss, specificallly, one of the stage is more dominant in their characters. However, probably that discussion is best left for another section of the website.
